Rubik’s Cube Solver – Project Description
This project aims to develop a program that can solve any given configuration of a Rubik’s Cube using an algorithmic approach. The solution need not be optimal; it only needs to reliably reach a solved state, regardless of the number of moves.

✅ Key Objectives:
Object-Oriented Cube Representation

Design a class-based structure to represent the 3D Rubik’s Cube.

Each face and its individual squares will be modeled to allow manipulation.

Manual Side Rotation Implementation

Allow each face of the cube to be rotated manually (clockwise or counterclockwise).

Ensure correct rotation logic, including the effect on adjacent sides.

Scrambling the Cube

Provide functionality to randomly scramble the cube into a solvable state.

The scrambled state will serve as input for the solver.

Cube Solving Algorithm

Implement an algorithm that solves the cube from any scrambled position.

The algorithm does not need to be optimal — any working solution is acceptable.

For each solving step:

Display the move performed

Show a visual/text-based representation of the cube’s state
